          The first step to economic success is receiving a good education – and receiving a good education starts well before high school graduation and enrolling in college. Many factors contribute to an individual’s success in high school – specialized learning needs, aptitude, language, financial needs, family and community and it is often hard to find the “silver bullet” solution that works for everyone’s situation. However, there are a number of factors throughout a student’s secondary education journey that are important indicators for success in high school and beyond. We call these the “A-B-C’s of success:
          A = attendance – make sure you show up,
          B = Behavior – make sure you are present,
          C = Curriculum – make sure you get prepared.
        </p>
        <p>These indicators are key measures that students, families and schools can focus for high school success. Here we measure, success is defined as graduating high school on-time and making a successful transition from high school to postsecondary*.</p>
        <p>To determine the most impactful indicators we followed a cohort of students through their 4-year journey in high school. Explore the indicators and outcomes throughout each high school year in the section below.</p>
